# Eric's Quote Generator

A heartfelt tribute project created to honor our dear colleague Eric Yapura on his last day at the company. This application generates shareable quote images featuring Eric's photo, allowing team members to create memorable messages that capture the essence of our time working together.

## Project Description

This web application allows users to:

- Create custom quotes with Eric's image
- Preview the quote in real-time
- Download the generated image
- Share their thoughts and memories in a visually appealing format

The design features a dark theme with deep blue tones, creating a professional and meaningful atmosphere that matches the significance of the occasion.
